This is my about page. :wave:

A South Florida native and a New Yorker at heart with a passion for coding. Developed web applications across different platforms such as social media, real estate, mental health and video games.

I am energized by learning new technologies and applying them to creative projects. Outside of work I enjoy playing ping pong and fantasy football, studying Chinese, exploring new coffee shops and riding my bike around Prospect Park on the weekends.
